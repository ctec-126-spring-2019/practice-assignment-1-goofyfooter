    <h1>My First JavaScript Project</h1>
</div>
 
<p>I have lived in Vancouver for a few years.  I work in tax accounting.</p>
<p>I never had a chance to learn JavaScript.  I have been self-studying Java.  I would like to have some foundamental skills in JavaScript through this class.</p>
<p>The most recent programming class I took was C at Clark College.  It was last summer.  I had a degree in Computer Information Science but that was 19 years ago.  I only worked in programming for less than a year after that.  I know:  Java 12, C, C++, HTML, CSS, PL/SQL, COBOL, LISP (Scheme), Prolog, Visual Basic.  Java is the coolest language in my opinion.</p>
